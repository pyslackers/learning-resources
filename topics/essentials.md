# Essentials

## Books

### [Learning Python 5th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Python-Powerful-Object-Oriented-Programming-ebook/dp/B00DDZPC9S/)
Comment by @luisarteaga : "Part I (Chapter 1 to 3) is a must read for every pyhton beginner. It is mainly about the python command line and some important functions to start. The other parts/chapters are a very good reference source for python essentials. But for some topics like generators I recommend looking for more code examples on stackoverflow."
