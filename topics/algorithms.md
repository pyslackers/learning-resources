## Books

### [Grokking Algorithms: An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people](https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230)
Comment by @luisarteaga : "I really love this book. It teaches you how to visualize common algorithms to understand them better. It is a good introduction into algorithms. I am not sure if this would be sufficient for a code interview."

### [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693/ref=sr_1_1ie=UTF8&qid=1494017030&sr=8-1&keywords=algorithm+design+manual)
This book is a great resource to learn how to design language-agnostic algorithms and analyze their efficiency. The language the author uses makes this book approachable for anyone interested in learning how to design algorithms. The first section is entirely about designing and analyzing algorithms and the second part provides a reference for popular algorithms.

### [Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Live-Computer-Science-Decisions/dp/1250118360/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1494016952&sr=8-1&keywords=algorithms+to+live+by)
Comment by @luisarteaga : "This book is great book for a smooth and entertaining introduction to algorithms with real life example. But it will not really help you to get ready for a code interview. I used it more like a bed time story."

### [Data Structure and Algorithmic Thinking with Python: Data Structure and Algorithmic Puzzles](https://www.amazon.com/dp/8192107590/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_8GAdzbAKVC800)

### [Introduction to Algorithms (textbook)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms)

A large comprehensive book of algorithms. The algorithms are written in pseudo-code. Many universities use this book to teach algorithms. It was mentioned that it may best to have a mathematics background to get the most out of this book.

### [All Algorithms implemented in Python](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python)
These are for demonstration purposes only. There are many implementations of sorts in the Python standard library that are much better for performance reasons.

## Code

### [Leetcode](http://leetcode.com/)
Website that provides contests and programming questions based on data structures and algorithms. The difficulty of questions ranges from easy to hard and there are many resources for people that are new to programming to learn how to apply these topics.
