## Books

### [Grokking Algorithms: An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people](https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230)
Comment by @luisarteaga : "I really love this book. It teaches you how to visualize common algorithms to understand them better. It is a good introduction into algorithms. I am not sure if this would be sufficient for a code interview."

### [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693/ref=sr_1_1ie=UTF8&qid=1494017030&sr=8-1&keywords=algorithm+design+manual)

### [Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Live-Computer-Science-Decisions/dp/1250118360/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1494016952&sr=8-1&keywords=algorithms+to+live+by)
Comment by @luisarteaga : "This book is great book for a smooth and entertaining introduction to algorithms with real life example. But it will not really help you to get ready for a code interview. I used it more like a bed time story."

### [Data Structure and Algorithmic Thinking with Python: Data Structure and Algorithmic Puzzles](https://www.amazon.com/dp/8192107590/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_8GAdzbAKVC800)

### [Introduction to Algorithms (textbook)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms)

A large comprehensive book of algorithms. The algorithms are written in pseudo-code. Many universities use this book to teach algorithms. It was mentioned that it may best to have a mathematics background to get the most out of this book.

### [All Algorithms implemented in Python](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python)
These are for demonstration purposes only. There are many implementations of sorts in the Python standard library that are much better for performance reasons.
